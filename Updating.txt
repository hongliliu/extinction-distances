Current Workflow

run_test_masers.py -> Make Maser Object (to store information)
		   -> Make IRDC3 Object (in charge of fetching and loading NIR data) <-- A much simpler class can handle this information
		   -> Parse DS9 Contour <-- But where is the contour generated? Maybe it was by hand? This should not be too hard to fix.
			-> IRDC3.findStarsInContour
			-> IRDC3.countBlueStarsInContour
		   -> BlueStarDistances
		   -> Save to Masers.pkl
Separately, we must run completeness.py
		-> calibrate_ukidss.py
We need to plot
		-> plotcompleteness.py
Separately, we need to run
		-> make_images.py

Sextractor is install in scisoft. Fine. But if I load scisoft my python environment is clobbered, so I can't use it.
